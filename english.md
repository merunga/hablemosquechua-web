#About

## ¿what is [@hablemosquechua](https://twitter.com/hablemosquechua)?

The [twitter account](https://twitter.com/hablemosquechua) is controlled by a robot, which
-in collaboration with humans- reconnects dictionaries, drops ideas, starts dialogues, inserting quechua language into the social networks.

@hablemosquechua was born as an experiment/prototype at [@escuelab](http://twitter.com/escuelab){:target="_blank"} around middle 2011. a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4NFPkpkIzQ){:target="_blank"} tells the story.

## ¿what does @hablemosquechua do?

- composes and emits spontaneously through twitter, phrases that take words from quechua-spanish dictionaries.
- works as an interactive dictionary you mention while asking and replies to you over DM.
- tries to animate the followers through vocabulary and grammar contests. 
- tracks the most active uses and greet them : )
- re-communicates other resources and services vinculated to the quechua language.

## ¿How does it work?

### Users/Enthusiasts:

If you need basic technical help you can contact [@kikomayorga](https://twitter.com/kikomayorga){:target="_blank"}

### Developers:
* If you are a developer, you can clone, fork, evolve and merge @hablemosquechua! The code is [here](https://github.com/merunga/hablemosquechua/){:target="_blank"} If you have an idea of how to make a better kind of an animal out of this robot we please ask you to get in touch with [@marianocrowe](http://twitter.com/marianocrowe){:target="_blank"}

#Do it YOURSELF!!!

(note: this documentation does vary and is usualy better updated in spanish)

## ¡@hq software is adaptable to the language/context you want!

Software behind the robot has been thought to be generic and easily reused/replicated. We have thought of different educational platforms based on this system:

An -almost- inmediate instance of @hablemosquechua, could be @hablemosnahuat (an account disseminating the "nahuat" language from Central América. Other uses for the robot might be to control other twitter profiles dedicated to specific communities, such as: @speakitgeek, @technicalspanish and other educational/useful stuff...


## ¿Other examples?

- "wherisXlocated?"
- thecolorsoftheflags
- who wrote what
- artistsinyourtown
- etc...

## Two ways to replicate @hablemosquechua:
You can very easily replicate the operation of @hablemosquechua, but using the profile and content that you want.

### 1) Replicate the @hq robot as a service ¡just aneed a twitter account!

* start your twitter session
* got to robot.hablemosquechua.org and grant permissions to the robot to connect to your twitter account. 
* create a dictionary. save it.
* create phrases or questions. save them.
* create a schedule for the times you think are ok.
* define and activate tweeting saesons. 
* done!

### 2) Replicate the complete hablemosquehcua robot ¡on your own server! 
* The source-code is [here](https://github.com/merunga/hablemosquechua/){:target="_blank"}

## ¿what does @hablemosquechua aim to?

- to develop a trend for revalorating quechua language through taking advantage from social networks.
- explore artificial life / robot-community interaction as a startegy to maintain a language alive. 
- offer a kit of opensource services and solutiones to go and rescue other languages and dialects. 

> In 2011, in less than 6 hours, the first functional version was deployed.
> During its first 5 hours, the robot had surpassed the 100 first folowers triggered by a single twitt.

## ¿can i participate in the @hq team?

Currently @hq is maintained by @sankaypillo, @marianocrowe and @kikomayorga. Nevertheless, the idea is that we can rotate the group of administrators, incorporating other quechua speaking enthusiasts to collaborate with the innitiative. If you speak or write in quechua and you are interested in actively taking part and become a deejay/community manager for @hq for some season, you can become quechua poet and co-promoter at @hq! To discuss this possibility contact [@sankaypillo](http://twitter.com/sankaypillo) and let us try out with your new DJ/CM talent in the beginning of 2014.


## ¿which quechua does the platform currently use?

* (needs update - in the meantime @hq is explring with the inclusion of comparissons between different quechua dialects as well)

(written in quechua by @sankaypillo early in early 2012, translated into english)
> About spelling and vocals (5) used by @hq: @hq opts and asks for understanding on using mainly quechua language form the Cusco-Collao region, and so also for disseminating the unified writing. We know that quechua isn`t spoken nor written the same everywhere, be because government entities or liguists promote one or another way of writing. We respect the persons who contact us and protest when something is not "well written". We know it is important tu study and recognize the different variants across Perú and Latin América, but for now, we are a team of volunteers that explores the possibilities for our ancient language inside technological contexts. It is in our plans to increment the functionality of the robot to specify variants and special cases that exist across the quechua speaking community in Latin America. 

>¡We thank for your understanding!

## ¿who takes care of @hablemosquechua?

[@hablemosquechua](https://twitter.com/hablemosquechua){:target="_blank"} is an experiment inniciated by 
[@sankaypillo](https://twitter.com/sankaypillo){:target="_blank"},
[@kikomayorga](https://twitter.com/kikomayorga){:target="_blank"}
and [@marianocrowe](https://twitter.com/marianocrowe){:target="_blank"} en 2011, at
[@escuelab](https://twitter.com/escuelab){:target="_blank"} under the inspiration of
[@runasimipi](https://twitter.com/runasimipi){:target="_blank"} and Amos Batto. 
[@hablemosquechua](https://twitter.com/hablemosquechua) thanks specially to the support from 
[The Foundation for Arts Inniciatives](http://www.ffaiarts.net){:target="_blank"}
for the support to the first relatively stable version close to the end of 2013.

- The successive programs for automation and management of the robot have been developed by [@marianocrowe](http://twitter.com/marianocrowe){:target="_blank"} initially as a quick draft in php, and in 2013 on javascript (client and server). The code is libre under GPL license. 
- The education of the robot in poetry and quechua language gets done by [@sankaypillo](http://twitter.com/sankaypillo){:target="_blank"}, 
- The robot idea came from [@kikomayorga](http://twitter.com/kikomayorga){:target="_blank"} and the [stereoreality environments](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6_0QouYptE){:target="_blank"}. 
- But nothing of this would have been possible without the vision and support from Jorge Villacorta, [José Carlos Mariátegui](http://twitter.com/tupacamauta){:target="_blank"}, [@escuelab](http://twitter.com/escuelab){:target="_blank"}, [ATA](http://ata.org.pe/){:target="_blank"}, [@ffai](http://www.ffaiarts.net/){:target="_blank"}
- The inspiration deffinitely came from the work of Amos Batto and the work from [@runasimipi](http://twitter.com/runasimipi){:target="_blank"}.
