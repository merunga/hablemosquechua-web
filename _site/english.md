## ¿what is [@hablemosquechua](https://twitter.com/hablemosquechua)?

The [twitter account](https://twitter.com/hablemosquechua) es controlled by a robot, which
-in collaboration with humans- reconnects dictionaries, drops ideas, starts dialogues, inserting quechua language into the social networks.

@hablemosquechua was born as an experiment/prototype at [@escuelab](http://twitter.com/escuelab){:target="_blank"} around middle 2011. a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4NFPkpkIzQ){:target="_blank"} tells the story.

> In 2011, in less than 6 hours, the first functional version was deployed.
> During its first 5 hours, the robot had surpassed the 100 first folowers triggered by a single twitt from [@escuelab](http://twitter.com/escuelab){:target="_blank"}...

## ¿what does @hablemosquechua do?

- composes and emits spontaneously through twitter, frases that take words from quechua-spanish dictionaries.
- works as an interactive dictionary to which you ask and replies over DM.
- experiments in animating the users through vocabulary, grammar and other contests. 
- tracks the most active uses and congratulates them : )
- re-communicates other resources and services vincultade to quechua language.

## ¿what does @hablemosquechua aim to?

- to develop an trend to revalorating quechua language taking advantage from social networks.
- explore artificial life / robot-community interaction as a startegy to maintain a language alive. 
- offer a kit of opensource services and solutiones to go and rescue other languages and dialects. 

## ¿who takes care of @hablemosquechua?

[@hablemosquechua](https://twitter.com/hablemosquechua){:target="_blank"} is an experiment inniciated by 
[@sankaypillo](https://twitter.com/sankaypillo){:target="_blank"},
[@kikomayorga](https://twitter.com/kikomayorga){:target="_blank"}
and [@marianocrowe](https://twitter.com/marianocrowe){:target="_blank"} en 2011, at
[@escuelab](https://twitter.com/escuelab){:target="_blank"} under the inspiration of
[@runasimipi](https://twitter.com/runasimipi){:target="_blank"} and Amos Batto. 
[@hablemosquechua](https://twitter.com/hablemosquechua) thanks specially to the support from 
[The Foundation for Arts Inniciatives](http://www.ffaiarts.net){:target="_blank"}
for the support to the first relatively stable version close to the end of 2013.

- The successive programs for automation and management of the robot have been developed by [@marianocrowe](http://twitter.com/marianocrowe){:target="_blank"} initially as a quick draft in php, and in 2013 on javascript (client and server). The code is libre under GPL license. 
- The education of the robot in poetry and quechua language @hq ows to [@sankaypillo](http://twitter.com/sankaypillo){:target="_blank"}, 
- The robot idea came from [@kikomayorga](http://twitter.com/kikomayorga){:target="_blank"} and the [stereoreality environments](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6_0QouYptE){:target="_blank"}. 
- But nothing of this would have been possible without the vision and support from Jorge Villacorta, [José Carlos Mariátegui](http://twitter.com/tupacamauta){:target="_blank"}, [@escuelab](http://twitter.com/escuelab){:target="_blank"}, [ATA](http://ata.org.pe/){:target="_blank"}, [@ffai](http://www.ffaiarts.net/){:target="_blank"}
- La inspiración, en definitiva se la debemos a Amos Batto y a [@runasimipi](http://twitter.com/runasimipi){:target="_blank"}. 

## ¿can i participate in the @hq team?

Currently @hq is maintained by @sankaypillo, @marianocrowe and @kikomayorga. Nevertheless, the idea is that we can rotate the group of administrators, incorporating other quechua speaking enthusiasts to collaborate with the innitiative. If you speak or write in quechua and you are interested in actively taking part and become a deejay/community manager for @hq for some season, you can become quechua poet and co-promoter at @hq! To discuss this possibility contact [@sankaypillo](http://twitter.com/sankaypillo) and let us try out with your new DJ/CM talent in the beginning of 2014.


## ¿which quechua does the platform currently use?

* (needs update - in the meantime @hq is explring with the inclusion of comparissons between different quechua dialects as well)

(written in quechua by @sankaypillo early in early 2012, translated into english)
> About spelling and vocals (5) used by @hq: @hq opts and asks for understanding on using mainly quechua language form the Cusco-Collao region, and so also for disseminating the unified writing. We know that quechua isn`t spoken nor written the same everywhere, be because government entities or liguists promote one or another way of writing. We respect the persons who contact us and protest when something is not "well written". We know it is important tu study and recognize the different variants across Perú and Latin América, but for now, we are a team of volunteers that explores the possibilities for our ancient toungue inside technological contexts. It is in our plans to increment the functionality of the robot to specify variants and special cases that exist across the quechua speaking community in Latin America. 

¡We thank for your understanding!
